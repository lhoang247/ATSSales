attacker MAC address 0a:00:27:00:00:00:00
attacker local ip address 192.168.1.1

pcsCompu_29 MAC: 08:00:27:29:cc:20
pcsCompu_29 local ip: 192.168.1.100

pcsCompu_dd MAC: 08:00:27:dd:84:45
pcsCompu_29 local ip: 192.168.1.101

attacker send APR hello package to every possible ip address under the 192.168.1.*
once it receive the replay from target address if will send a ping package to test the useability 
{
    no 1 to no 3459
}

attacker try to find the open port on the target computer(101) by sending TCP [SYN] package to some common ports
{
    3460 to 4487 all the package that attacker send to targe computer
}

targe computer replays says prot 22, 80 are open
{
    3478, 3480
}

attacker start a secure communication the communication with target computer from the port 39804 to port 22     4503

attacker supports SSH-2.0-libssh_0.8.7    4503
target computer decided to use SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.9p1     4505

They decided to use aes256-ctr as their encryption algorithm mac: hmac-sha2-256 and exchange the public key    4503 - 4511

client protocol SSH-2.0-libssh_0.8.7


attacker use the establish the connection with target computer port 22 by using its port(
39810 22 26 20 06 08 18)      4522 to 63331

5107 - 6737
attack use those connection ports connect sending packages to the target customer. It might be guessing the authorize user name or password by applying Brute Forcing

attacker also denine all the access request from the target computer 

6738 - 6989
attacker found what he/she wants and disconnect the connect with port 22 on target computer 

6990 - 7046
attacker start a new connection with port 22 by using port 40152 and input the password he found from password program got Brute Forcing 
login to the target computer and open the port 80
might also allowing the file transmission 

7047 - 7236    need more detail
attacker establish a net connection with port 80, transfer the data by port 80 from target computer.
